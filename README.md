# pcmd v2.0 EXPERIMENTAL

## Achievements and aims ##
 - As the successor to pcmd v1 this project aims to give a better syntax, faster commands and improve upon the layout of not just how the terminal works, but how coding it is too.
 - I have rewritten the entire thing from practically scratch and am constantly improving upon this.
 - Reworked change directory command to have no errors and weird things (For example: You used to be able to do cd /.../..././ etc)
 - Added if command for better use of pcmd files etc.
 - Reworked the entire coding experience for easier to use and more readable code.
 - Actually used proper pythonic syntax
 - Added all_defs.py for a safer, more improved upon way of adding functions.
 - Added IS_CMD command for better command checking.
 - Fixed problem where you had to scroll to line ~300 to see any cmd functions.
 - Implemented less buggy features and improved upon the way things get interpreted overall.

## Use ##
This project is still in an experimental phase and may be very buggy, if you still want to install it, just download the zip file and you may play around with whatever you want.

## Conventional use release date ##
I cannot confirm a release date for conventional use as of yet, however expect it to be some time in 2023 q2 - q3 (It may come earlier or later depending on how fast everything gets finished).

## Things to add ##
1. An installer for unix and windows.
2. Better support for unix and windows (I think as of right now it is mostly OS compatible however I cannot say for sure).
3. Better if statement handling.
4. An updater for unix and windows.
5. Better variables in .pcmd files.
6. MORE COMMANDS.
